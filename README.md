## Overview

This program uses node, JS and MySQL and NPM's like mysql and inquirer.

The program is meant to simulate a storefront that stores product information like ID, Name, department, quanitity in stock, and price in MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory depending on the amount that they order. If they order more than the quanitity in stock, they are told there isnt enough and asked to make another choice.
